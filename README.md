# Fatigue_Control_P300_EEG-Analysis
This repository focuses on processing and analyzing EEG data to explore the P300 ERP component. By comparing the responses of control and fatigue groups to target stimuli, we investigate how cognitive fatigue affects brainwave activity. The code includes data filtering, averaging ERP waveforms, and visualizing the results.
